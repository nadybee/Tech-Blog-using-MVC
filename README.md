  ## Description
  This is a blog built from scratch using the MVC model. Users can see the blog posts, and if they want to comment or create their own blog, they can login, or sign up. After a user logs in they can make comments and create their own blog. It is built with handlebars and bootstrap on the front end and sequelize/mySQL on the back side.

  ## Usage
  You can find the deployed version [here](https://warm-dusk-87697.herokuapp.com/). Please add a blog post or make a comment on any of the posts! <br>

  You can also follow the installation instructions if you want to run the application on your local host.  

  ## Installation
  - First clone the respository.
  - Create your own `.env` file using the .env_example as a template.
  - open the `db` folder and connect to mysql. Run the command `source schema.sql` to create the database.
  - now open the `server.js` folder and install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
  - run `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start up the server and create the models.
  - kill the server and run `npm run seed` to seed the database with the table seeds.
  - now the application is seeded and ready to run again.
  - enjoy!
